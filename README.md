# Game Title: Tongue Twister Challenge

## Objective
The objective of the game is to improve pronunciation and listening skills by correctly repeating tongue twisters.

## Materials Needed
- A Clubhouse room or similar audio chat platform.
- A list of tongue twisters (like the ones provided earlier).
- A moderator to facilitate the game.

## Instructions

### Preparation
- The moderator prepares a list of tongue twisters, categorizing them by difficulty (easy, moderate, challenging, very difficult, extremely difficult).

### Game Setup
- Create a Clubhouse room and invite ESL learners to join.
- The moderator welcomes participants and explains the rules of the game.

### Rules of the Game
- Each team or pair will take turns selecting a difficulty level (easy, moderate, challenging, very difficult, or extremely difficult) to attempt a tongue twister.
- One member of the team or pair will be the "speaker," and they will attempt to say the tongue twister correctly.
- The other member of the team or pair will be the "listener," responsible for listening carefully to ensure the tongue twister is pronounced correctly.
- The speaker has one attempt to say the tongue twister without stumbling.
- If the speaker says the tongue twister correctly, their team or pair earns points.
- If the speaker stumbles or mispronounces the tongue twister, no points are earned for that round.
- Rotate through teams or pairs, taking turns selecting and repeating tongue twisters.

### Dividing Participants into Teams or Pairs
- The moderator can use one of the following methods to divide participants into teams or pairs:
  - Random Assignment: Assign participants to teams or pairs randomly. You can use online tools or simply draw names.
  - Self-Selection: Allow participants to choose their partners or teams if they prefer.
  - Mixed Levels: If there are participants with varying English proficiency levels, you can mix stronger speakers with learners who may need more support.

### Scoring
- Keep a scorecard to track the points earned by each team or pair. You can assign different point values to tongue twisters based on their difficulty level (e.g., easy = 1 point, moderate = 2 points, challenging = 3 points, etc.).

### Optional Variations
- Speed Round: Add a timer to increase the challenge. Participants have a limited time (e.g., 20 seconds) to say the tongue twister correctly.
- Pronunciation Correction: If a participant stumbles on a tongue twister, the moderator can provide gentle correction and allow them to try again.
- Translation: After successfully saying a tongue twister, participants can translate it into their native language for additional practice.

### Wrap-Up
- At the end of the game, the moderator can announce the winning team or pair based on their total points.
- Encourage participants to practice these tongue twisters regularly to improve their English pronunciation skills.

By dividing participants into teams or pairs and providing clear rules, this game fosters collaboration and friendly competition while helping ESL learners improve their pronunciation and listening skills.
